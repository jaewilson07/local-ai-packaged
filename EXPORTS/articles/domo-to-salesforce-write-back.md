Anyone heard of Domo Integration Cloud? Yeah...me neither 😂

Quite possibly the most overlooked *premium* feature of Domo, Integration Cloud allows you to create low-code solutions to many of your more complicated integration problems. In this quick example, I enrich Salesforce accounts with data from my billing and email marketing tools.

Being a premium feature, I'm guessing most of us don't have this enabled in our instances. If you'd like to give Integration Cloud a test drive, you can head over to the dojo instance where we have it enabled.
