Heyyooo!

In this video tutorial, I go over a practical use case for the Java CLI by creating an append Magic ETL dataflow. If you've ever banged your head against recursive dataflows, then you know a common pain point is performance degradation as the dataset steadily increases in size. With a few quick adjustments to the JSON definition file, you can create a much more performant dataflow, saving you loads of processing time down the road!
