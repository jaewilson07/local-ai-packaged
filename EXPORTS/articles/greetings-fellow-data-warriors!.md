My name is Robert and I am a Python & Domo developer.  I come seeking refuge from the battles fighting alone.  Seems we end up fighting alone grinding away our days when somebody else out there did the same thing and could share their solution.  I come here seeking knowledge, comradery and to live the gifted life of the lazy coder!  Work smarter, not harder!

I have specialized in using Python to get data into Domo.  I run into a lot of issues trying to get data from OMS/CMS system into Domo.  In general I find most API's to be a poor source of data for BI needs.  The data is mostly raw, has limitations on how much data can be pulled and the data itself tends to be very bland.  I prefer to get the data from the OMS/CMS by either SFTP report dumps or web scraping the reports.  This allows me to sync large amounts of data daily without the API limitations.  Plus I can show the client the same data they will see in their OMS/CMS without data integrity issues.  (Ever try pulling data directly from an OMS/CMS SQL server? No thanks!)  API's have their place and often I find myself creating my own API interfaces to get data that Domo misses like with Shopify where they don't give you all of the inventory items GRRR!

A year or so ago the Domo Workbench Quickbooks connector stopped working for weeks and I had a client to setup.  So I built my own custom Quickbooks Desktop export script in Python which uses the windows scheduler to run the script.  I use QODBC and have a developer license so the keys are very reasonable.  I will be posting this on here.  The cool thing with this script is that it allows me to access ALL tables and reports in Quickbooks.  The reports from the Domo Quickbooks tool is limited and has issues.

I am now looking into custom apps to expand my skills so I can be a well rounded Domo developer.  I think the 3 areas of focus from my perspective are custom apps, custom connectors and Python data processing.

Cheers and let me know what you think and if you know of any open source Quickbooks financial custom apps, I am all ears!
