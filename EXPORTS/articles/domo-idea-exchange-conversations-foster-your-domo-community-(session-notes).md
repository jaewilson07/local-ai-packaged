[Does “build it and they will come” work?](https://youtu.be/dUFCwkIFz8k?t=824)

- Building community IS a job!

- “Swing and a miss” - Wait till the right time!  You don’t get too many mulligans

Participation and Adoption

- build a community Landing Page with shootouts, news and announcements

- create spaces to showcase achievement

- Highlight  popular content

- Meet your community where they are at (does everyone live on Facebook?  Meet them there!)

- Social lubricant makes it easier to do the hard stuff

**Great Quotes re: scaling Adoption**

“How would you like to breathe again” – on converting people to Domo

Use Domo to : “Providing value you can't get anywhere else.”

**How might you ...**

- Let people know projects that might be interesting

- How might you encourage community members to help curate content?

- DO you NEED a private site (or should users leverage public communities (domo-community or stack overflow)?

- What are (un)structrured ways to build play into community building?

**Conducting Structured research on community needs**

- schedule regular focused training and focus group feedback sessions to understand how users are leveraging tools

- Conduct “train the trainer” sessions to empower champions.

- Sit in on the job to understand people’s needs

**How do you inspire people to value learning?**

- Put education on the calendar. “Take 30 minutes and see how far you can get”
