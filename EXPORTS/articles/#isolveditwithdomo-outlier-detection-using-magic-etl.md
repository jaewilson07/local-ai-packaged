Sharing an approach we implemented in our instance of Domo to identify outliers (unusual or exceptional values) for our accounting team. The Domo Magic ETL tool set provided a really easy way to build a data model that would detect outliers, and shifted a manual process (searching for needles in a haystack) to true exception processing.  Please reach out if you have questions:  [https://www.linkedin.com/in/oldbay444/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oldbay444/)
