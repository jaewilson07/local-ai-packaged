# How (and why) I got started in Content Creation

Getting started creating your first YouTube video, or even just a tutorial for internal consumption can feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be!  Even the name of the activity, "Content Creation" seems like the side hustle everyone has but no one likes! :D

This article is your cliff notes of all the things to consider when you get started in content creation.  But my most important tip?  **Just press record.**

*Record the video.  Post it (you can use a BS title).  Close your laptop and tackle the rest tomorrow. *

In the morning, for a more formulated approach, I've documented some of the learnings I picked up over the way.

## 3 reasons why you should get started in Content Creation

-
**You can point to your expertise and community engagement when it's time to go job-hunting, or grovel for a raise.**  Anyone can say "I am an expert."  But it's quite another thing to be able to point at 15 blog posts, 100+ YouTube Videos and a visible history of community engagement.  *Even if your content isn't something you can post publicly, post them as private videos and private articles so you have one polished place you can send your boss or a recruiter to.*

-
**Creating content is a great way of solidifying learning.**  Every time I learn something new, I  try to make a video about it or at the very least a publishable set of notes.  If you have to explain something you learn it.

-
**Supporting community helps grow the community and builds goodwill next time you need help on a project.  **Who knows, that goodwill might

For me personally, *when I went job hunting, in several cases I skipped the technical screening because I had demonstrated expertise.*  Usually, it boiled down to whether people liked my presentation style and thought I'd be a good fit for the role.  Honestly, I found myself driving a lot of interviews because I knew exactly what kind of work I wanted to do and I needed to know the new organization would be a good fit for me.

## 🚀 TLDR, your simple pipeline for creating content

-
**Put your content on YouTube** (have good links in the description!)

**Decide if you want to make a 'brand' channel** or just post it to your personal channel (I recommend brand channel, it's a few extra steps but it allows you to separate your private life from your work life).

-
**Use YouTube videos as the starting point!**  Don’t embed MP4 videos in sites that Google can't find!  If your video can't come up in a google search you aren't creating reusable work!

Avoid uploading your video as a doc card to [domo-dojo.domo.com](https://domo-dojo.domo.com/) or embed your video to dojo community (embed a link)

- Don't just upload your content to a webinar platform.  No one will be able to find it, and it doesn't help you produce a body of work that you can point people to!  If you wall your content behind sign-up links (ahem) it's a great way to build marketing leads (or at least frustrate people who want to see the content, but it's a terrible way of building a brand!)

- **Share the YouTube video on LinkedIn.**

-
**Create an blog post** summarizing your video or with additional commentary on DataCrew, [https://datacrew.circle.so/c/articles-and-knowledge-base/](https://datacrew.circle.so/home).

Makes it easier for you to build a body of work you can point to.  (searching for articles in Dojo / Community is awful b/c it's just forum software)

- Encourage conversation (which you can find later) in the comments

- If you want to share on Dojo, or write a blog post for Domo, put it here, then Domo can share it / relink.

# 🎙️ How to Record a Tutorial Video / Recording your Screen Share

**Adjust your screen for small monitors.**  Remember that people are going to be watching on YouTube, so zoom in so the text is easier to read. (Best resolution for display capture would be one of the following – 1080p: 1920x1080 · 720p: 1280x720)

**Try not to have an ugly background! **At the very least blur your background, but also consider having a good light so your (probably) cheap webcam can produce a good image.

**Write out the words to your problem.  **For visual learners it can be easier to read about the problem rather than listen.

- If you’re presenting an ETL or solving a problem, write out the problem or show a very simple dataset in Excel.

- If you’re covering a production pipeline, simplify your problem to the fewest number of tiles to teach the point (and comment your code)

- If you’re describing a process, consider using a diagram.  Lucidchart.com is AMAZING

### 💗 Building a Brand using Channels on YouTube

When it comes to uploading, you should start by considering whether you care about developing a brand.

**Option 1 - 🤷‍♀️ I don’t care about creating a Brand**

Post content to your personal youtube account & share links.

This is probably the easiest method, but all your personal search history intermingles with you professional persona.

**Option 2 - 🤔 I want to create a Brand // Create a Brand Account on Youtube**

Separate your personal life from your work life.  Creates a sub-account under your normal google account.  You can have many sub-accounts each one dedicated to a different online persona.

[https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9367690?hl=en](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9367690?hl=en)

This option makes sense if you’re trying to build a professional persona.  You’ll still login with your personal credentials, but your “domo_channel” will be separate from your gaming search history.

**Option 3 - 💀 I don’t want to deal with YouTube.**

Post your video to Google  💽 [Drive ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZD2yAp2PgrZ9BYXxTTYaN2RDtsQ-87XT?usp=sharing)⬅️, Jae Wilson will upload it for you under DataCrew’s YouTube Channel.

## ✏️ What should I call my Video?

- For the search engine call your video Domo + <product feature> - <use case>

- If you want to use tags (supposedly they don’t matter) but let’s do Domo, iSolvedItWithDomo, DomoCommunity, Sensei (if you’re a sensei) and anything else you feel relevant

- Include a description here’s a boilerplate to get you started

## ✏️ Video Description Boilerplate and HashTags

Write your boilerplate for all your content:  YouTube, Blog Post, LinkedIn Post.  Just do it once and use it again for all your content!

*Feel free to modify.  Make sure to include the hashtags in your video description.*

## ✏️ How to Write an Effective Blog Article (in [datacrew.circle.so](https://datacrew.circle.so/)) Quickly

Write your post in a platform that's easy to use (I lean toward Google Docs or directly in DataCrew).  I avoid Word because it does weird stuff with formatting.

**Copy/Paste/Fill In this simple structure**

-  Business Use Case // “what is this gonna help me do” // “how does it relate to what i’m doing?”

- Technical skills / tools required (maybe alternative tools just in case)

- Video

- Screenshots of Pipeline / ETL walkthrough (optional)

**Remember, just push record.  **In blogging, the equivalent of that is to publish the simplest version of your blog post.  Then walk away and deal with the rest in the morning!

﻿*I spent HOURS making this YouTube video, and I really didn't want to spend any time on a blog post.  So I wrote the worst *[*blog post*](https://datacrew.circle.so/c/developerdomocom-community-edition/basic-forecasting-in-magic-etl)* ever, just to force myself to do the thing.  Later one of my coworkers asked me about how I structured the dataflow, so I added content at the bottom.*

**Avoid Wall of Text.  Use Formatting.**

In Circle.so the /slash command gives you access to some formatting stuff.
In Google Docs the @at command does a similar thing.

﻿*Slash commands!*

**Write a Great Intro.  Persuade me to read your article!
**Structure your article (and use formatting) in a way that gets me through your intro and into the meat and potatoes.  (but lead with the meat so i can decide if i want to get to your potatoes).

*Give me a relatable situation (the use case), tell me why it matters, then tell me your proposed solution*

This is super hard to do, so sometimes, I just start with a handful of ideas I want to communicate, just type until I get bored, then go back and reformat the article.

Alternatively, pick 3 things you want to say, have defining bullets for each of the three things, then call it good and walk away!

*Circle.So (this blogging platform) does support "save as draft"* so you can walk away for a day or two and come back to it when you're fresh.  Or just publish it, and edit it later, chances are you won't bother to edit, and THAT'S FINE!  Sometimes the goal can be quantity over quality, and then if we care, come back for quality.

**Notes for documenting a Dataflow**

- Simplify the viz (zoom in and don’t overwhelm

- Consider ALLCAPS for operations and function names and snake_case for variable / constant names.

﻿

**Always include Links**

Remember your boilerplate (see above) for all your content, YouTube Post, Blog Post, LinkedIn Post.  Write it once and always reuse it!

- Links to your Tutorial, or related content,

- Links to Dojo

- Links to Slack

Supposedly crosslinking is good for SEO.  I don't know if that's true, but in any case it does keep people reading your stuff, so that's always a good thing.
