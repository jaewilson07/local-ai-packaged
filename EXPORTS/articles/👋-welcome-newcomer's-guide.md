## How to use Spaces

Make sure to [introduce yourself](https://datacrew.circle.so/c/say-hello).

📱 Feel free to grab the Circle App for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/circle-communities/id1509651625) (no Android yet) 📱

Have an interesting idea you want to bring to life?  The [Builders Club](https://datacrew.circle.so/c/builders-club) is where folks can collaborate on projects.  Alternatively, if you have a project you're proud of that you want to show off, link a video from YouTube or Vimeo and tell us about it.  Make sure to leave links or contact information!

Make sure to post any [events](https://datacrew.circle.so/c/events) that may be of interest to the community!  These can be events you're hosting or event's you're participating in.

Code Snippets, Gists, tutorials, and developer docs can go [here](https://datacrew.circle.so/c/developerdomocom-community-edition/).  Whereas content with a more best-practices, educational resources or consultative bent should go under the [KBs](https://datacrew.circle.so/c/articles-and-knowledge-base/).
