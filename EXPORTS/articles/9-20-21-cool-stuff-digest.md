## Is Kimball and his Dimensional Modelling wisdom out of date?

In the [May 24 Cool Stuff Digest](https://datacrew.circle.so/c/discussions-and-help/5-24-cool-stuff-digest), I posed the question of whether Kimball's Dimensional Model was falling out of date.  I mean, he wrote the first drafts of his book back in the 70s and 80s before columnar indexing existed.

Then recently a Domo Consultant, shared this video with me from Dave Fowler at [chartio.com](https://chartio.com).
﻿

In the video, Dave references a community-authored book "[Cloud Management Data](https://dataschool.com/)"

I appreciated the video as well as the book because many of the best practices proposed are in alignment with how we handle Domo Implementations.
