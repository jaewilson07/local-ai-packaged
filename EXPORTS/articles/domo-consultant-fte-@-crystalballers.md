We're looking to hire another FTE consultant at Crystal Ballers.
What we're looking for:
Deep experience in creating value with Domo
Experience in ETL (inside and outside Domo)
Preferably based in the US (I'm not currently set up to employ internationally)
Bonus if you can write some python, R or JS

What you get:
Dang cool team
Work from home
Higher pay
Always new problems
Opportunities to go beyond consulting
