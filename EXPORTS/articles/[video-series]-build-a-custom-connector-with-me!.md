Hello!

Ok, so this one has been in the works for quite a while! Ever since I attended the IDEA Exchange conference and watched Lacey Roger's session [on building a custom connector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQLwYgU9smc), I became obsessed with building them! Coming from an accounting background, creating custom data pipelines was a new realm for me, and I loved how Domo enabled its users to build 3rd party connectors for software that currently wasn't in the AppStore.

Since then, I've built around a dozen custom connectors, and I have learned quite a lot in the process! Even with all their quirks, I still love building custom connectors, and I'd like to share my learnings in hopes they can help you avoid some of my pitfalls and headaches. 😅

As always, you can find me on the Domo User Group Slack (@Elliott). I would love to answer any questions you might have about custom connectors!

A Humble Domosapien,

Elliott﻿
