... this is going to sound obvious... but

## Employers

- Post your Job Opportunities here.  But also ... keep in mind Domo is currently a small community.  You're competing for talent!

- This currently is a small community, but we might know people that aren't on DataCrew who might be a good fit

- Are you just looking for FTEs or are Consultants an option?  Is it 100% Domo or are you looking for a blend of skills?

## Candidates

- Link your intro on DataCrew ([https://datacrew.circle.so/c/discussions-and-help](https://datacrew.circle.so/c/discussions-and-help)) and make sure it has the relevant content from your resume or cover letter.

- Use DataCrew to sell yourself.  When we click your profile we can see articles you've posted!  Make sure we can find the iSolvedItWithDomo YouTube videos you've done!

- When we click on your profile, what are we gonna see?  Make sure your tags are up to date (are you Domo Certified?  do you have a Black Belt in Dojo?)
