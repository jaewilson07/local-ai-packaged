# Create metrics that use different dates

Hi, I have a problem that I can't seem to find an answer for and I was hoping someone here would have an idea.

I want to create a metric that counts memberID by memberStatus. The end result would be StatusA_Cnt, StatusB_Cnt, etc.  The problem is that for StatusA_Cnt I want to filter by DateA and for StatusB_Cnt filter by DateB.  Is there a way to intersect the date, status and count in a formula?
