This post are my notes from the webisode from the PowerBI.Tips
﻿

﻿

## What does success mean for a BI Team?

- Can you answer "yes" to "are you providing value to the business?

- Are you enabling users to discover new insights from data?

- Are you instilling trust in your users? (certification)

- How many people are asking for access to content?

- Number of reports published per month

## Food for thought:

- In one year, when you and your boss high-five your success, why are you high-fiving?

- What are your goals?  Who does the work?  Is a COE supporting other departments?  Or is all the dev effort centralized with BI?

- Can you measure report improvement?

- Measure customer satisfaction (survey about the report)

## Examples of Metrics

**Efficiency**

- How many reports / cards do you have hanging off your core datasets?

are people making copies? (is centralization failing?)

- are people leveraging certified datasets?

**Adoption**

- Active Users

- Customer Satisfaction (feedback process)

- 80/20 split?  Report Views by User

- How many man-hours did you save?

- How many business teams / use cases are you supporting

- How frequently are business owners able to make decisions

- New Reports - Views Rolling 30/60/90 days

- New Reports - Views MTD vs PM MTD vs PY MTD

**Value / Time**

- Month on Month usage

- Report Lifespan (engagement over time OR retirement)

- Views to Refresh Minutes Ratio (compute is expensive)

**Improving Data Quality**

- SLA: Report Refresh Rate & Failure rate

- Days since Report View & Number of reports retired
