Hey guys, I'm one of the founders of the DataCrew, I run the [OnyxReporting](https://www.youtube.com/c/OnyxReporting_2) YouTube Channel as well as the Domo IDEA Exchange conference.

I use my decade of experience in BI consulting to mentor and train new Domo consultants, upskill partners, as well as do customer implementations.

In addition to Domo, I dabble in app development and using data science workflows to solve business problems.

## My BHAG

When I got involved with the Domo Dojo, I got excited by the idea of being able to go to any major city in the US and grab a beer with people and talk about the cool data projects we're working on.

As I met more of the freelancers, I was amazed by the variety of skills that people have that complement  (or in some cases supplement) my own!

From those experiences, I was inspired to form and nurture a community of data professionals and freelancers! My goal is to grow this community into a global network of skilled individuals who can exchange ideas, refer and support each other on short term and long term projects.

## I am a gun-for-hire

My consultancy, Onyx Reporting, provides training, implementation, and program support services.  We can accommodate hourly, retainer-based, and project-based pricing.

## My CV

**written by a salesguy I worked with

If you have a project in Domo that involves big data, complex ETL, regimented visualization requirement, or business process integrated workflows, Jae is the first person you want your implementation team to bounce ideas off of because he not only understands the Domo stack, but also has enough customer-facing consulting experience to poke and prod at implementations to assess whether they will hold up to business requirements.

If you’ve got a coin toss between implementing in MagicETL, Adrenaline Dataflows, or Redshift, Jae Wilson has an opinion on every option rooted in an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each transformation tool brings to your data pipeline.  As such, when clients complain that Domo isn’t living up to performance expectations or is too unwieldy to maintain, Jae Wilson has the first pair of eyes you want on your implementation

Jae has a decade of experience designing and building reports, data warehouses, OLAP cubes and more-recently, Domo implementations, for small (Rogue Brewery in Portland, OR), medium (Twinings Tea US), and enterprise-sized clients (Aston Martin, and Tipico to name a few).

From market basket analysis, inventory planning, balance sheet, and income statements, customer journey modeling, sales pipeline planning and forecasting, the list of uses cases he’s covered goes on, but each implementation is built on a foundation of traditional dimensional modeling, tempered by an awareness of trends in big data, bounded by real-world customer expectations and requirements.

Who is Jae?
Jae is the guy who reads the Domo release notes religiously
He loves mentorship and builds video responses to questions in the Domo Community site over morning coffee and maintains a YouTube channel of Domo tutorials
He has a bat-phone to the Domo Labs and Engineering services team because he’s first in line to stress test beta products and the team at HQ trust and value his feedback.
He regularly teaches himself new data science and app development techniques so he can push his clients to achieve more with Domo.
