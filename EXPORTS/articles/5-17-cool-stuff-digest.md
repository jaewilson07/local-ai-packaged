### Make sure to Hound your CSM about the Customizing Dashboard Filters Beta.

This is a game-changer and probably one of the most frequently requested Beta features after the "Window Functions in Beast Modes" feature switch.

Seriously, if you don't have a relationship with your CSM, work on building one, they are your best advocate when stuff starts breaking in Domo.

### UNION quietly slipped into DataSet Views Beta

IMHO there's no reason to use Fusions anymore.  DataSet Views are the superio UI and UX (once they iron out the kinks).
