When my fiancé visited Switzerland to finish her MBA she brought me back a Swiss Army knife. This knife stays in my bag and I use it all the time to open amazon packages, quickly unscrew things or open bottles. While I love the versatility of such a tool, it doesn’t actually *excel* at any of these tasks. Assembling furniture is easier with a screwdriver and you’ll never see a bartender on a busy night opening bottles with a multitool.

The same can be said for building effective Business Intelligence (BI) charts. Many new report builders tend to jam a single chart full of information, especially when given a new BI tool to play with. *“Look! This chart shows X, Y, Z and the colors show A, B, C!” *And while that chart may show those all of these things, it doesn’t do them well.

A good chart will tell you a story and help guide business decisions. It will be clear and concise and the reader should be able to immediately gleam what the chart is showing you with a quick glance. The longer you look it should provide additional insights to the overall narrative but not provide unrelated or unnecessary information.

**Tips for avoiding a Swiss Army Chart:
**

- Use the [appropriate chart type](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-of-graphs-for-data-visualization) for the data you are trying to show.

- Make your chart answer one business question at a time.

- Provide a thoughtful summary that includes the business question.

- Drill-downs should provide more specificity to the answer and help answer the overall question.

- Label the axes so the reader is immediately aware of what they are looking at.

Follow these tips to start building screwdrivers and bottle openers and keep the multi-tool in your bag!
