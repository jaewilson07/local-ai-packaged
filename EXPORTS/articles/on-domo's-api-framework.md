Daren Thayne, Domo CTO, and Ken Boyer, Sr. Program Manager at Domo share best practices and customer stories for getting out of the Domo UI and embracing the [#API](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/api) framework at the [Domo IDEA Exchange](www.onyxreporting.com/schedule) hosted by [OnyxReporting](https://www.onyxreporting.com).

The Domo UI includes powerful tools for managing single-use case implementations; however as dataset, dataflow, card and page counts grow, governance and management challenges scale too.  Domo's API framework provides powerful tools and SDKs for automating governance and orchestrating pipelines.
