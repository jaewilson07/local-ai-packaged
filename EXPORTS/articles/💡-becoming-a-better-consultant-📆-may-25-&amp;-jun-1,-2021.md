## Recording from 6/1

﻿

## Is Classical Training Important is it relevant

- for SMBs maybe the Data Warehouse is less important

- if not this then what?

- a mature vs. less sophisticated implementation

- build your own burrito bar

is BI in data like art? or are there truly binary outcomes?

- some people need paint-by-numbers

- Quality Gates? what's the MVP for a handoff state? are there things that every handoff should have?

## Qualities you're looking for in a new hire / Building your Team

- Governance & Process (Program maintenance oversight) // Major Domo

- SC / Technical Implementation // Data Engineer / COE

- Business Consultants / management & value consultant

- project & product managers

- SMEs (data specialist, industry expert)

## Domo + IT friction (creating room for everyone)

- everything the business creates is a prototype (which becomes requirements for IT)

- if the business does self-service → you can get it out by Thursday (and IT Isn't doing fire drills). IT is not responsible for what the business creates
