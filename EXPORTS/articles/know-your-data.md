Before you jump in to the abyss of data, know what you are starting with and how you could get to an end point.

-  Find unique fields, joins make duplicates if incorrect

-  Lets Date - matching dates is going to be a challenge, UTC, MST, or Unix?

-  Notes, Notes, Notes,  you will get busy and forget, take notes and put them in DOMO for later

- Ask for Help, lot of people work with Data everyday, and we like to talk about it.  Check here, StackOverflow, DOMO Dojo or even google.
