With this tool, admins can limit or prevent unauthorized access following data or credential leaks, keeping data secure. The password blocklist can also help protect data by blocking passwords used in demo and testing environments from gaining access to production environments.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042934474-Setting-Password-Requirements

](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042934474-Setting-Password-Requirements__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy1yRvqwqA%24)[**Variables in Analyzer and Dashboards**](https://www.domo.com/product/new-features#variables)**:**  Variables is an exciting package of features that allow users to level up simple dashboards to interactive data apps. With Variables, users create dynamic metrics that can be used in Beast Modes, cards, and dashboards. No coding required.

Now, data analysts can build simple data apps that enable business users to answer their own questions by adjusting dimensions and metrics themselves. Variables means powerful self-serve analytics, resulting in faster insights and less friction between business and data teams.

Variables has a variety of exciting self-serve applications, including:

- What-if-analysis capabilities – ex: mortgage rates, inventory forecasts, margin impact

- Dynamic analytical views – switch out dimension or metric columns in your chart ​

- Time comparison analysis – create sophisticated period-over-period visualization analysis​

- Guided analysis – each user can modify control inputs and visualization updates with user selection

(Does this mean that dark mode is available for the web? No)

[**Workbench Support for Duplicate Job Templates:**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.domo.com/product/new-features*workbench-support-for-duplicate-job-templates__;Iw!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy21otYEsg%24)** **Domo customers using Workbench to generate datasets often want to run multiple similar jobs or create multiple similar datasets from the same database, only changing a few details about the query. Workbench now supports duplication of job templates, making it significantly easier to create multiple jobs at scale, saving time and manual effort.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/9338871306135-Duplicating-a-Job-in-Workbench-5-2

-
**Simplified Admin Experience – **Domo Everywhere and Brand Kit admin now falls under the main Admin page within Domo, making it easier for Domo Everywhere admins to change settings, update subscriber lists, and control look and feel all in one place.

-
**Saved filter views **– Before publishing content with Domo Everywhere, Domo customers can now build and save filters to ensure that data is shared with their external audiences exactly as they want it to be. This will help reduce the burden on the end user to see the data they’re looking for and provides Domo customers with a level of control before publishing.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418999855639-Filter-Options-for-the-Embedded-View-Experience](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418999855639-Filter-Options-for-the-Embedded-View-Experience__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy2mjr0WWQ%24)

-
**Whole Page Filtering **– With whole page filtering, end users can still filter data across multiple individual cards, creating the experience of a cohesive dashboard while maintaining that controlled content output Domo customers want.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043437993-Sharing-Content-Outside-of-Domo-with-Embed#h_01GFNH58Q069B2TVP43TMRV886](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043437993-Sharing-Content-Outside-of-Domo-with-Embed*h_01GFNH58Q069B2TVP43TMRV886__;Iw!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy12FTT5WQ%24)

-
**Authorized Domains** – Domo Everywhere admins can ensure that embedded content stays in its intended locations by adding approved domains to the Authorized Domains list. Any content embedded outside of these domains will simply fail to render, keeping that content secure.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043437993-Sharing-Content-Outside-of-Domo-with-Embed#h_01GFNH58Q069B2TVP43TMRV886](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043437993-Sharing-Content-Outside-of-Domo-with-Embed*h_01GFNH58Q069B2TVP43TMRV886__;Iw!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy12FTT5WQ%24)

-
**Publish Dynamic PDP – **Customers publishing content to multiple subscribers can now filter that content at the publish level, using PDP-like controls to ensure that subscribers only see data and content relevant to them. This will save Domo customers time and manual effort by consolidating maintenance of publication jobs pulling from the same datasets.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045120554-Publishing-Content-to-a-Subscriber-Organization#3.0.8](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045120554-Publishing-Content-to-a-Subscriber-Organization*3.0.8__;Iw!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy2_T4cT-Q%24).

-
**Dataset Switching – **With dataset switching, Domo customers no longer need to create custom cards or dataset for each separate data viewer or customer account, and can instead choose what dataset powers a given visualization at the time it is displayed. This cuts down on money and time spent administering the embedded environment while also reinforcing the security measures that prevent the wrong data being displayed to the wrong viewer.

-
**Auto-Subscribe – **Domo Everywhere now allows end subscribers (the customers and partners of Domo customers) to automate all tasks required to establish trust between the subscriber and the publishers they expect to receive content from.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/6523741250455-Domo-Everywhere-Routing-Creation-and-Mapping](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/6523741250455-Domo-Everywhere-Routing-Creation-and-Mapping__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy10l3P4hQ%24)

-
**Default Sharing Rules – **Often, Domo customers use Domo Everywhere to monetize their data as they share it with *their* customers and external partners. With this new capability, subscribers to a published Domo Everywhere environment (e.g. the customers of Domo customers) can now automate the process by which they accept published data and share it out within their organizations.

-
**Dashboard Embed Exports** – End users can now export embedded dashboards as a PDF or PowerPoint, including all filters applied and the layout of the dashboard. This will be especially helpful for those utilizing scheduled reports, as they can now export and send the entire dashboard to their audience, rather than creating scheduled reports for individual cards.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/4492108625687-Exporting-Embedded-Content
](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/4492108625687-Exporting-Embedded-Content__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy2Efas4cg%24)

[**Governance Toolkit Enhancements**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.domo.com/product/new-features*governance-toolkit-enhancements__;Iw!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy0si-y2GA%24)**: **

-
**Observability Metrics – **With Observability Metrics, customers can pull any and all DomoStats reports across multiple instances into one primary instance, saving time and effort. Additionally, a Domo Access Token Account can be used to assign one common Username/Password combination to pull DomoStats reports from all of their Domo instances.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/8275510785559-Governance-Toolkit-Observability-Metrics](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/8275510785559-Governance-Toolkit-Observability-Metrics__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy2N90Z1Ew%24)

-
**Triggered reports - **Customers can now schedule reports to trigger on a Dataset update or alert trigger, offering more insight and governance on scheduled reports.[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/9301034807575-Governance-Toolkit-Triggered-Reports](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/9301034807575-Governance-Toolkit-Triggered-Reports__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy1-tdD2Zg%24)

[**Sandbox enhancements**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.domo.com/product/new-features*sandbox-enhancements__;Iw!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy0S99fVQA%24)**:**[** **https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403367344023-Domo-Sandbox](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403367344023-Domo-Sandbox__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy2luT44KQ%24)

-
**Connector support – **Customers who have a connector in their development instance can now transport connectors to test and production instances via Sandbox. This allows them to transport the configuration of that connector across instances, meaning they can now use that connector in different ways for different stages of development.

-
**Link mapping **– Sandbox now allows a user to give a mapping for items in their repository that otherwise wouldn’t have a clear link. If a user has a page that points to another page that is not in the repository, Sandbox will give the user an opportunity to map the appropriate link during the promotion process.

-
**Heuristic content mapping **– Customers using datasets with key similarities (including name, schema type, and others) will now be able to automate the mapping process across instances using Sandbox. This will be a huge time saver, especially for customers using a common naming convention across instances.

[**
Jupyter Notebooks Enhancements:**](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.domo.com/product/new-features*jupyter-notebooks-enhancements__;Iw!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy08PBt5ug%24)[ https://domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047400753-Jupyter-Workspaces](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/domohelp.domo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047400753-Jupyter-Workspaces__;!!JmoZiZGBv3RvKRSx!8lh6In14h7mS5Kc3jwNsVAT9NgtsEhGtoPMpkjGsbrQR_bPhx3wF799mtRtJ2zk-GAYbA4YIcdMRUXzPfYhnFy19uBbP5g%24)

-
**Support for Domo Credentials - **Customers using Jupyter Workspaces can now reference Domo credentials directly, providing greater security than raw credentials from notebooks.** **

-
**Workspace sharing - **Jupyter administrators can now enable sharing on Workspaces. With sharing enabled, administrators and owners can now allow different users to edit and run a Workspace by adding them to it, increasing collaboration while maintaining admin control over resources.
