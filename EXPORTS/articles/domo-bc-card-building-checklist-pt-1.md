## Tell Better Data Stories

​"Does storytelling matter?"  ​Due to advancements in the accessibility of big data technologies, analytics teams have access to previously unparalleled volumes of data, but not an ounce of value can be created unless insights are uncovered and translated into actions or business outcomes.

Brent Dykes, @analyticshero, and Marc Anton Clavel, @wonvel, share tried and tested techniques for improving your data storytelling skills at the [Domo IDEA Exchange](www.onyxreporting.com/schedule%EF%BB%BF)

### Questions to consider when putting the finishing touches on your Data Viz

- Use the same naming convention for titles

How are drillable cards identified?

- What is the time period for each cards?

- What is the question the card is answering?

- Avoid duplicated filters (unless having filters for each section and then make sure filters only apply to a section)

- Have consistency on the location of the legends

- Make sure that legends have the right colours

- If the legend is too small, create a Tex Box with a description of the Legend

- Make sure that Hover labels make sense to the end-user

- Make sure that Summary label makes sense to the end-user

- Avoid repeating summary numbers - use 1 card for the summary number if present in several cards

- Use the same colour for the same metric/dimension

- Avoid white space when possible

- Make sure there is no hidden information or words cut

- Check for spelling errors

- Check for the title of Drills

- Check that all drillable cards have drill enabled (not filtering)

- Add a text box to aid the user journey for long pages

- Apply log scale for cards with data with very big differences

- Round up numbers if they are representing entire items

- Avoid duplicated information
