# Shared Health Check Patterns
# Standard health check configurations for common service types
# Use these as templates, adjusting ports and paths as needed

# HTTP-based health checks
x-healthcheck-http: &healthcheck-http
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 40s

# Database health checks
x-healthcheck-db: &healthcheck-db
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 10
  start_period: 30s

# Fast health checks (for lightweight services)
x-healthcheck-fast: &healthcheck-fast
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 10s

# Slow health checks (for heavy services)
x-healthcheck-slow: &healthcheck-slow
  interval: 60s
  timeout: 15s
