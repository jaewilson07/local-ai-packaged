# Phase 4 Specification: The YouTube Bridge

## 1. Workflow
1.  User creates an album in the Frontend called "My Reel".
2.  User clicks "Connect YouTube" in settings.
3.  Service monitors "My Reel".
4.  New videos added to "My Reel" are uploaded to the user's YouTube channel.

## 2. Technical Components
* **Google Auth:** OAuth2 Web Flow (offline access).
* **Storage:** Store `refresh_token` in the Sidecar DB (Encrypted).
* **Deduplication:** Store `youtube_video_id` alongside the `immich_asset_id` to prevent double uploads.

## 3. Definition of Done
* Adding a video to the "My Reel" album triggers a YouTube upload within 10 minutes.
